## Bash and PHP? Ew!

Seriously, Bash is _perfect_ for gathering the source files and PHP is _perfect_ for generating HTML documents from a template.

The source is tiny, easy to read (see for yourself!), and pages get generated at a rate of 42 per second, which is fast enough for me.
Oh, and the whole project took a couple hours, including this README.
